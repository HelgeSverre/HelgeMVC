### Difference between development and stable releases?
#### Stable
If you just want to download and use HelgeMVC without running into any weird untested features or experimental "randomness", I strongly suggest that you download the version called "Stable Release", this is meant for the general public and for developers who just want to get shit done.

#### Development
However, if you want to contribute to the development of HelgeMVC, you may download, fork or otherwise modify the Development release and submit it back to me to be merged into the next stable release.


### Problems?
If you have any problems, please [email me](mailto:email@helgesverre.com) or submit a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/helgesverre/helgemvc/issues) and I will get back to you ASAP.
